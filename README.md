Setup


Start by forking and cloning this repository into your account.
Add your 08-redux repository as a remote with the command: git remote add 08-redux <insert-08-redux-repository-url-here>


git remote -v should display origin and 06-scalable-auth-with-docker
Pull your 08-redux changes into the master branch with the command: git pull 08-redux master. Now there will be merge conflict in README.md file.
Update the README.md file to these instructions, and remove the instructions from 08-redux.
Copy the React components as created in the 07-thinking-in-react repository, and place them in the src/components directory for both slack and trello projects respectively.
Commit the changes. You are now ready to start working on this programming task.
